<p>Chapter <a href="2.html" target="blank" title="html specification">5 has been published </a> as Eom, J., Fehsenfeld, S., Wood, C.M. (2020). It was previously believed that ventilation would not affect ammonia excretion due to diffusion limitation. We showed this to be true in “resting” trout, but once this limitation was removed via upregulation of the Rh channel system in the gills by ammonia loading, ammonia excretion became sensitive to ventilation. Hyper-ventilating trout excrete more ammonia, showing that the response is beneficial at times of ammonia loading.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 has been published as Eom, J., Wood, C.M. (2020). In order to further study ventilation in trout, I innovated a ventilation flow measurement device to quantify it directly, so as to replace the original van Dam chamber. The new system is based on the same principle, but replaces mechanical overflow devices with an electromagnetic flowmeter, and is far less stressful to the fish.  This chapter demonstrates its use to directly measure ventilation during experimental hypoxia and hyperoxia in trout and goldfish. The new system has been used in Chapter 7, and in as yet unpublished studies which are not included in the thesis. A patent application has been filed by UBC.</p>
